### Update 1/16/23

Need to put this project hold for the moment as the semester is about to start soon.
The functionality is mostly there. Tried to implement localstorageAPI, but I think
I misunderstood some of the documentation. The design also needs to reworked, but at this 
point I feel maybe moving along with the curriculum would be more fruitful. I would 
like to come back and implement an actual database solution and backend with node once I
learn that stuff.
